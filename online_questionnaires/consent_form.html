<h2>Information Sheet</h2>

<p>Thank you for taking interested in this study. I am concerned with how people <i>produce</i> and <i>understand</i> written language. You must be a <u>native English speaker</u> to take part. Please note that you can withdraw from participating at any time by not pressing the submit button, in which case your data will not enter further analysis. Alternatively, you can also email one of the researchers to remove your data from the analyses.<br><br>

There are 10 items per page, comprised of <i>complete sentences</i> intermixed with an equal number of <i>incomplete sentences</i>. Your task is firstly to <u>provide a rating for each <i>complete</i> sentence</u>. Here is an example for a <i>complete</i> sentence:</p>

<ul type='none'><li><label><b>The racing driver gave the mechanic the torn overall after the race.</b></label></li><br>
<ul class='likert'><li><i> makes no sense </i></li><li><input type='radio' name='trial_2' value='1' /></li><li><input type='radio' name='trial_2' value='2' /></li><li><input type='radio' name='trial_2' value='3' /></li><li><input type='radio' name='trial_2' value='4' /></li><li><input type='radio' name='trial_2' value='5' /></li><li><i> makes perfect sense </i></li></ul></ul><br>

<p>As shown above, there is a 5-point rating scale underneath the sentence for you to rate how much the sentence makes sense by clicking one of the points from <i>makes no sense</i> to <i>makes complete sense</i>. If you think the sentence sounds weird, rate closer to the left; if it sounds fine, rate closer to the right. You are encouraged to use the full range of scale points available.<br><br>

Secondly you're being asked to type in a <u>reasonably sound completion for each <i>incomplete</i> sentence</u>. Here is an example for an <i>incomplete</i> sentence: </p>

<ul type='none'><li><label><b>The professor graded the student's homework assignments before ...</b></label></li><br>
<li><label for='trial_1'><input type='text' name='trial_'1' id='trial_1' value="the deadline."></label></ul><br>

<p>Incomplete sentences are followed with an input box and it's entirely up to you how to complete the sentences. E.g. for the above you could write: "the deadline", "preparing the lecture", "she checked her emails", or any other ending that turns it into a grammatically correct sentence. There are no "right" or "wrong" answers (we are primarily interested in your <i>first impressions</i> of the sentences).<br><br>

There are <b>128</b> sentences in total over <b>13</b> pages. Once you complete one page click the Submit button at the bottom to reveal the next page. Please make sure to work through each item at a reasonable pace,   without skipping any items or going back to ones that you have already completed. The experiment should take approximately 30 minutes and you will be timed.<br><br></p>
