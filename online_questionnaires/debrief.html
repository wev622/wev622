This experiment was designed to elicit a phenomenon known as <i>syntactic priming</i>. Shortly after reading or hearing a sentence, people are more likely to reproduce the previous sentence's structure when producing new sentences. In this experiment, we were investigating whether you would reproduce the ending attachment (animate or inanimate) of the <i>completed sentence</i> in the <i>incomplete</i> sentence:<br><br>

The tourist photographed the bishops (<b>animate</b>) in the cathedral (<b>inanimate</b>)...
<ol>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...WHO WERE dressed in black (<b>indicating low attachment</b>).</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...THAT WAS recently refurbished (<b>indicating high attachment</b>).</li>
</ol>

Depending on the attachment (i.e. high or low attachment) in the completed sentence, you should have a higher tendency to reproduce that attachment in the incomplete sentence:<br><br>

The student read through their notes (<b>plural</b>) for the exam (<b>singular</b>) that ...
<ol>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...WERE incomprehensible (<b>indicating low attachment</b>).</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...WAS going to be difficult (<b>indicating high attachment</b>).</li>
</ol>
